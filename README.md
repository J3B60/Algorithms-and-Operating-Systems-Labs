# Operating-Systems-Labs
## A brief explanation of repository contents

This repository is setup as a demonstration of my work completed during my degree in regards to Operating Systems.

- The aim of this work is to use Linux to explore the role of operating systems on computers to see how pipes and threads work and how memory managed.

- The tasks consited of using the Linux terminal commands, writing bash shell scripts and writing/compiling small C programs that explore Linux/POSIX features such as threads.

- Used Linux bash commands: strace, man, getpid, getppid.

- Wrote shell scripts and used strace to find pipe/forks/clone/child processes.

- Wrote small C programs that make forks and another using **POSIX threads**.

- Added **Mutual Exclusion** semaphore to POSIX threaded programs.

- **Inter process communication** using messages/signals.

- **Memory management** using chuncks and mmap.

- Some of the work is based on Beej's guide to Unix.
